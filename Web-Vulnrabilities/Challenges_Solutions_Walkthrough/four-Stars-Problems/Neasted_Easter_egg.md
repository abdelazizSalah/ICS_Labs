* open eastere.gg file after downloading it
* go to **cyberchef** to decode the encoded message
* use from Base64 
* then use Caeser cipher to resolve the encryption **ROT13**

## Why it works
* because the encoded msg contains == at the end so it looks like base64
* and then when we read the msg after decoding, it looks like normal english but letters are shifted, so just use caeser.
