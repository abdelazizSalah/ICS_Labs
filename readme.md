# ICS_Labs

## Overview
ICS_Labs is a collection of hands-on machine learning and network security exercises focused on intrusion detection for Industrial Control Systems, featuring dataset analysis, flow generation, custom distance metrics, and an unsupervised stacked denoising autoencoder pipeline

## Structure
- `Brute_forcing/` - cryptanalysis examples and brute force experiments relevant to feature robustness in ML models  
- `Buffer_over_Flow/` - exploitation labs that demonstrate memory corruption, used to generate adversarial samples for IDS evaluation  
- `MD5_PDF_Collision/` - practical MD5 collision artifacts and scripts for studying data integrity attacks and their impact on ML-based detection  
- `Man_in_the_Middle/` - ARP poisoning and TCP payload modification experiments for creating realistic attack traffic for supervised and unsupervised models  
- `TryhackmeLabs/` - curated exercises for network security fundamentals and threat modeling  
- `Web-Vulnralibilities/` - web attack patterns useful for feature engineering in intrusion detection systems
